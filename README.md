| ------------- |:-------------:| ---------------------------:|
| 1. /src/frequency.py | /wc_input/      | /wc_output/med_result.txt   |
| 2. /src/runningMedian.py     | /wc_input/      | /wc_output/wc_result.txt       |

=============================

### Usage:


##### Feed the files to the Input directory and run:
##        `run.sh`
